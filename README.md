# NuDotCalibrationSystem

This project is for the NuDot Experiement https://jgruszko.web.unc.edu/experiments/. I am student at UNC who will be graduating in May 2022. I am working with Dr. Gruszko to develope the code and electronics to controll the calibration system for the NuDot experiemnt. The goal of this experiement is to detect nutreinoless double beta decay. Neutrinoless double beta decay is a very rare phenomenom. Because of this, it is difficult to distinguish signal from background during detection. NuDots goal is to reduce the background by detecting cherenkov radiation from single electron events produced by background events as opposed to the double electrons given off by double beta decay. 

The goal of my code and electronics is to move a point beta ray source to an exact height, inclination, and rotation. Knowing these allows NuDot to calibrate the precise timings given by the detectors. These timings are extremely important for event building, where we determine details about the event causing the signal such as the position and energy.
